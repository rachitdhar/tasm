//	first.tasm
//
//	This is a very short example to depict
//	a simple TASM program.
//
//	Here, we simply put the char 'A' to the
//	memory location 0x18A88 (or 101,000) -
//	corresponding to the start of display
//	memory. This is then printed to stdout.
//
//	Every instruction block must have a label
//	within which it is contained.
//
//	The "main" label is a required label for
//	a tasm program, as it specifies the
//	entry point.

main:
	put	0x18A88	 	"A"
	out
